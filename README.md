# IEKF_AUV_Cave_Navigation

Introduction:
This is a final research project forÂ NA 568/EECS 568/ROB 530 MOBILE ROBOTICS: METHODS & ALGORITHMS WINTER 2020.
The goal of this project is to use Invariant Kalman filtering on data gathered from underwater cave systems for autonomous localization. Currently this implements and references two open source InEKF systems cited respectively.

Current status:
Early Planning
